*steps (to understand what is happening)

~this is python boto basic project.
~Python boto 3 is used to talk to aws (cloud)
~developers need to talk to cloud from local computers

~developers cannot log into aws console over and over.

~So they need to talk to their aws console via API (via local computer)

~boto is programming that one can.

~in order to do this, you need aws (client app) - this app can talk to your aws online account

~in aws app (shell app or cmd app). you need to configure your credenentials(login and password)

~so, on cmd or shell, do following -
aws config 

~this will ask you for username and password, and also, the vpc(which basically means region - like usa,india,europe).

~keep hitting 'enter' on keyboard

~once, done, aws is configured.

~you are ready to now talk to -
your aws account from local computer.
